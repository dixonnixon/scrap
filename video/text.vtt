00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:03.315
Okay.

1
00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:05.475
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone,

2
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:06.835
depending on where in the world you are.

3
00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:09.915
Um, uh, welcome to our first

4
00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:12.115
of our AI fireside chat series.

5
00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:15.395
Um, today, myself, uh, I'm Kevin McGee.

6
00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:16.595
I'm the CTO for Zeit.

7
00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:17.875
And, uh, Constantine, uh,

8
00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:19.355
Luan, who's the head of data science.

9
00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:21.315
You know, we're going to, you know,

10
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:24.315
we're gonna have a chat today, um, about all things AI

11
00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.795
and what Zeit is doing in that space.

12
00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.675
We're gonna do this as a, as a, as a series, um,

13
00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:31.355
over the next, you know, uh, few weeks and months.

14
00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:34.355
So, uh, we're not gonna probably go into massive amounts

15
00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.835
of detail in every area, but in, in future sessions,

16
00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.195
you know, we'll, we'll do some live demos, you know,

17
00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:40.315
we'll bring some other people along

18
00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:42.035
and have a, have a conversation.

19
00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:44.035
But today we're just gonna introduce some of the things

20
00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:46.155
that we've been doing, you know, over the last few months

21
00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.675
and, you know, some of the upcoming things.

22
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.075
And, you know, we, we'll go from there.

23
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:52.875
So, with that in mind, um, Constantine,

24
00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:55.675
we've been doing AI in inside for, you know, many years now.

25
00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:57.915
You know, we've, you know, we've, we've, we've got,

26
00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.075
you know, uh, quite a bit of capability.

27
00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.435
Um, just briefly, you know, do you want to bring everybody,

28
00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:07.075
you know, up to speed on, you know, just

29
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.635
what we've been doing and, you know, uh, and so on.

30
00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:14.845
And you're on mute. So we've started, well, yeah.

31
00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.965
Nice book. So, yeah. Hi. Hi, Kevin. Thanks for the intro.

32
00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:22.325
And yeah, I mean, I think we've been doing like at, at Zeit

33
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.165
and previously Scraping Hub doing, um,

34
00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:26.365
like various projects for a while.

35
00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:29.205
I think the biggest one recently was the, uh,

36
00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:32.925
automatic extraction, which is now part of, uh, Zeit API,

37
00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:36.285
where the main goal is to, uh, do extraction

38
00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:39.645
of like a few different data points, uh, like data types,

39
00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:41.285
such as like article products,

40
00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:43.525
show postings from all kinds of pages.

41
00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:48.165
And the magic here is that it, um, like it works on, uh,

42
00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:50.805
any website, like it is trained on some websites,

43
00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:53.845
but we check how it works on websites it haven't seen.

44
00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:58.685
And this makes it like robust to like any website changes.

45
00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:03.005
And also it means that like we have people coming to us

46
00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:07.645
and they can hit, like run, run their website,

47
00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:08.925
like run their jobs

48
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.725
and get the results, uh, immediately,

49
00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:13.405
which like makes the whole process much shorter.

50
00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:17.445
Yeah. I think putting this in context for anyone

51
00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:20.125
who may not be familiar, like the significance of this, uh,

52
00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:22.565
I suppose is the traditional way of,

53
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.965
of doing web scraping was to write a lot of code

54
00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.365
and using, you know, frameworks like scrape

55
00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.285
or other, other tools, you know,

56
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.365
so software developers write a lot of code,

57
00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:33.925
and then of course, if the underlying website changed,

58
00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:35.605
you know, the, you know, you had

59
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.325
to rewrite the code and make adjustments.

60
00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:38.445
What we're talking about

61
00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.365
and what's been in place is this idea of, you know,

62
00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:43.885
essentially no code, you know, at scale, you know,

63
00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:45.965
that we've been bringing in, which is, which is incredible.

64
00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:47.965
Um, I, I want to pick up on something

65
00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:51.275
that you were saying there as well that you, you, you kind

66
00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.035
of have been passing mentioned that, um, yes,

67
00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:57.435
we've had this auto extract product, um, in, in the market

68
00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:58.635
for, for quite a while,

69
00:02:58.855 --> 00:03:02.085
but we're, we're, we're sunsetting that individual project.

70
00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:05.605
We're rolling it into our, uh, design API product, you know,

71
00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:08.165
maybe just like, you know, bring, um, you know,

72
00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:09.805
the audience up to speed on why we're doing that.

73
00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:14.325
Uh, yeah. Yeah. So I think the main reason is what we, uh,

74
00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:17.525
see that, like, to extract the data we need

75
00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:18.925
to also download the page.

76
00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:21.405
And so automatic extraction handles both

77
00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:22.885
downloading and extraction.

78
00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.685
And, um, very often people want

79
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.405
to customize the download process.

80
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:30.685
Like they want to maybe set a different location,

81
00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.925
maybe they perform some actions in the browser

82
00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:38.045
or like tweak some like yeah, JavaScript setting on and off.

83
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:42.245
And, uh, this has a very big overlap with a general problem

84
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.405
of downloading the pages,

85
00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:44.805
because some people still want

86
00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.085
to do the extraction themselves

87
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:49.205
and they want to download, um, the data.

88
00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.245
And this is like what one

89
00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.765
of the things which ITPI like the main thing,

90
00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:55.205
which API solves,

91
00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:58.485
but it didn't really make sense to have like one service,

92
00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:01.205
which does like downloading and extraction

93
00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:04.005
and another separate service, which does only downloading,

94
00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:05.805
and they have like different ways

95
00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:07.365
and like more limited ways

96
00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:09.085
of customizing the downloading part.

97
00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:12.245
So that's why we Yeah, put it, it makes a lot of sense

98
00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:15.205
because we can benefit from Yeah, better.

99
00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:17.365
Like API unified billing,

100
00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:19.365
the customer has only one bill to pay.

101
00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:23.765
And yeah, it just feels, I think, much better to use, um,

102
00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:27.845
like, and much we can have much more features with the same,

103
00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:29.405
uh, like size of the team.

104
00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.165
Yeah. Okay. Brilliant.

105
00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:36.205
Um, uh, also maybe to expand a little bit on, you know, the,

106
00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:38.645
the data types that we currently support in,

107
00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:41.565
in your traditional kind of extraction capability.

108
00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:43.605
Oh, yeah, yeah. So the, the main data,

109
00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:44.925
like the data types,

110
00:04:44.925 --> 00:04:48.885
which we see like the most used are product, which covers

111
00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:51.885
as like very large e-commerce, like large number

112
00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:53.765
of e-commerce use cases, and then article.

113
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:58.205
So article is normally, um, like it's, um, uh,

114
00:04:58.355 --> 00:04:59.565
like news websites,

115
00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:03.605
but it can also be, blogs can also be like any, any kind

116
00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.205
of like publications which look like an article.

117
00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:10.685
Uh, and then, um, we also have, for these two,

118
00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:12.365
we also have data types which help

119
00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:14.045
to implement crawling more efficiently.

120
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:16.485
Like, for example, uh, product navigation,

121
00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:20.125
which would get like the links to, uh, subcategories, links

122
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.885
to the next page in the list, links to digital products.

123
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.085
And on top of that you can do the crawling.

124
00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:28.325
And then, um, yeah, same for, for, for article.

125
00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:31.525
And then we also have like, job posting, uh,

126
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:35.565
and then we have like in, in automatic extraction, uh,

127
00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:38.045
we had a larger number of data types,

128
00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:41.765
but we only like carried over the ones which saw the most

129
00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:43.845
adoption, uh, website, API,

130
00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:47.125
and then we'll be slowly moving them as like,

131
00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:50.525
as people see the need for them, uh, in inside API.

132
00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:52.555
Okay. No, brilliant.

133
00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:55.395
Um, I, I think one of the interesting, you know,

134
00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:57.645
and I kind of alluded to it, you know, a little bit earlier,

135
00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:02.275
um, you know, we're, we're getting really close to,

136
00:06:03.015 --> 00:06:05.355
you know, the, the requirement that for, for many,

137
00:06:05.355 --> 00:06:09.635
many use cases, you know, the need to write custom code is,

138
00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:11.835
is, is probably gonna be, you know, few

139
00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:13.955
and far between is, is kind of our hope, you know,

140
00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:16.395
won't always be the case, but that's kind of our hope.

141
00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:19.155
But, you know, behind the scenes, you know,

142
00:06:19.155 --> 00:06:21.035
and we don't, we, we haven't released this, you know,

143
00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.875
publicly, but one of the things that we, we have created

144
00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:25.915
and your team has, is, is kind of created

145
00:06:25.975 --> 00:06:28.435
and built is, is this idea of, you know, kind

146
00:06:28.435 --> 00:06:29.595
of the vi visual annotations

147
00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:33.995
and quick fixes that that really, um, speed up the ability

148
00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:36.355
to retrain, you know, the, the models.

149
00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:39.635
And so it's a, a kind of a two-parter question one, well,

150
00:06:39.695 --> 00:06:41.915
why do we need to, to retrain the models?

151
00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.315
And, you know, and just a little bit about,

152
00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:45.675
you know, well, how does that work?

153
00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:47.795
Right? Right. Yeah.

154
00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:51.195
Like w we, we see that with machine learning instruction,

155
00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:53.075
as I say, yeah, it's like super nice

156
00:06:53.075 --> 00:06:54.475
that it works on any website,

157
00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.035
but then, uh, as it's based on machine learning,

158
00:06:57.175 --> 00:06:59.595
it can make mistakes and it will make mistakes.

159
00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:03.195
And for some projects it can be like, not too bad,

160
00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:05.515
but for some projects we really want like,

161
00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:06.675
the best quality possible.

162
00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:09.875
And so, um, we like people

163
00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:13.155
or we would notice a, an error if we're doing a project

164
00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:16.515
for a client, or like a client would notice, um,

165
00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:18.795
like a incorrect extraction.

166
00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:23.275
And then like, uh, previously we would have to, okay,

167
00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.835
add this page and update it, retrain the model,

168
00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.835
and this whole cycle might take like weeks and,

169
00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:31.195
but now we can actually do this whole

170
00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:32.555
cycle in minutes instead.

171
00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:37.595
And the way we do this is that we can, uh, like, um,

172
00:07:37.815 --> 00:07:40.715
add some like hints to the model to guide it

173
00:07:40.715 --> 00:07:42.435
to the correct, uh, extraction.

174
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:45.235
And, uh, this hints they're based, um,

175
00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:48.075
like based on like selecting specific

176
00:07:48.105 --> 00:07:49.475
like areas on the page.

177
00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:51.235
And they, they don't have to be exact.

178
00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:54.235
For example, we would often see, okay, we are like,

179
00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:57.435
let's say we're picking up some price from related products,

180
00:07:57.495 --> 00:08:01.115
and instead of like having to specify exactly from

181
00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:03.235
where we need to pick the price, we could just say, okay,

182
00:08:03.405 --> 00:08:05.275
don't look in this area of the page,

183
00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:08.275
and this area can be quite generic, just some container

184
00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:09.355
with related products.

185
00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:12.395
And that immediately excludes this area for the model,

186
00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:13.475
but then it is able

187
00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:15.395
to pick up the correct price from the right,

188
00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:16.955
uh, part of the page.

189
00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:20.315
So this allows us to be quite robust to any, like,

190
00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:22.075
website changes or model changes.

191
00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:24.475
So that worst case we fall back

192
00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.035
to the default model behavior,

193
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:29.955
but normally we, we just, um, uh, yeah, obtain correct

194
00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:31.715
and improved results this way.

195
00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:34.835
Yeah, I think it's, it's potentially one of those, uh,

196
00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:37.115
sessions that we might do down the line.

197
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.595
It'd be great to show everyone just, uh, some

198
00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:41.955
of the capability that we have, you know, around doing that.

199
00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:44.515
And, you know, and I think it, it leads into this topic

200
00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:49.075
that, you know, Zeit for many years has been driving this,

201
00:08:49.455 --> 00:08:52.755
um, this vision to, to remove the complexity

202
00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.925
and to remove the challenges that people have in this space.

203
00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:58.685
Um, and you know, you've, you know, we've,

204
00:08:58.685 --> 00:08:59.725
that's why the whole idea

205
00:08:59.725 --> 00:09:02.045
of AI extraction was created in the first place.

206
00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:05.045
It's, you know, the whole reason why ZI API was created, it,

207
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.725
it removes an awful lot of the challenges.

208
00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:11.385
But last year we created a, a, a capability

209
00:09:12.365 --> 00:09:15.415
that was particularly revolutionary in this,

210
00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:16.655
in this space, you know?

211
00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:18.975
And so, you know, it's the, it's the ability

212
00:09:19.035 --> 00:09:20.935
to do everything that you just described there

213
00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:23.095
from a raw HTML perspective.

214
00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:26.415
And, you know, I'd love for you to just expand maybe on

215
00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:28.615
that, you know, one, well, why, why is this so,

216
00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:29.895
you know, revolutionary?

217
00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:31.095
Why is this so significant?

218
00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:34.135
And, you know, and, and, um, you know, and, and,

219
00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:35.575
and how is it different

220
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.735
or better than, you know, what has proceeded, um, and so on.

221
00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:39.935
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

222
00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:43.415
So when we started the project first, like, our idea was

223
00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:46.655
that like the quality is what is going to make or break it,

224
00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:50.055
because if we don't reach high enough quality, we, yeah,

225
00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:51.535
we're not going to be useful.

226
00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:55.495
And, uh, that's why we decided, okay, we want to like, put

227
00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:58.615
as much useful features as we can into the model.

228
00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:00.975
And that's why in addition

229
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.015
to providing it like the HTML three

230
00:10:03.315 --> 00:10:06.575
and like other, like the text of the page, we also took the

231
00:10:07.185 --> 00:10:08.815
screenshot of the whole page

232
00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:13.095
and, uh, found a clever way to combine this.

233
00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:17.135
Um, like the, the screenshot features with the page, uh,

234
00:10:17.455 --> 00:10:19.095
features and HTML level features.

235
00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:21.935
And, um, this is a bit similar to

236
00:10:21.935 --> 00:10:23.535
how the human sees the, the page.

237
00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.735
Let's say you see, okay, this is like some big thing.

238
00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:28.695
It's like a title that's maybe a name of the product

239
00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:30.095
or the title of the article.

240
00:10:30.595 --> 00:10:33.055
And then you might see, okay, this is like clearly the price

241
00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:34.815
and this small thing is not a price.

242
00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:38.815
Um, and this, this gave like a large boost in quality.

243
00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:42.655
But the drawback as we like, uh, carried over with this,

244
00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.895
we saw more and more, uh, like drawbacks

245
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.375
with this, uh, approach.

246
00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:51.415
Like one is, uh, that the cost implication that, uh,

247
00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:54.375
browser rendering is always going to be more expensive than,

248
00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:56.935
uh, downloading just page thel of the page.

249
00:10:57.315 --> 00:11:00.215
And the difference can be like, yeah, five times or so.

250
00:11:00.675 --> 00:11:03.335
And another, another drawback is, um,

251
00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:07.615
sometimes a browser rendering would be, uh, less reliable,

252
00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:10.855
uh, because there might be like various reasons

253
00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:14.695
for the rendering to, to not work e exactly as we want.

254
00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:18.695
Um, although like on some websites, it is mandatory

255
00:11:18.755 --> 00:11:21.375
to render it because we need to execute the JavaScript.

256
00:11:21.435 --> 00:11:23.815
So we, we still want this capability,

257
00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:27.415
but we thought, okay, can we do it without rendering?

258
00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:31.215
And initially we got like, quite a big drop in quality, uh,

259
00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:32.455
from that, uh,

260
00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:34.855
because the, the model didn't lacked this like,

261
00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:37.135
whole page understanding, whole page context.

262
00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:39.455
So we only looked at the individual parts of the page,

263
00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:42.335
but didn't understand how they relate to each other.

264
00:11:42.955 --> 00:11:44.615
And then we found out that actually

265
00:11:44.755 --> 00:11:47.895
by like adjusting the neural network architecture

266
00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:51.255
to like include some, like, uh, elements, uh,

267
00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:53.055
like recurrent neural networks there,

268
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:56.645
we could actually like close the gap between the raw

269
00:11:56.705 --> 00:11:58.005
and rendered extraction.

270
00:11:58.305 --> 00:12:01.685
And then we, yeah, this is already released in ITPI,

271
00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:04.205
so you can, when doing the extraction, you can specify

272
00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:08.605
that you want to use, uh, extraction from, uh, roach ml,

273
00:12:08.605 --> 00:12:11.045
and that would be like around 10,

274
00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:12.725
10 times faster on average.

275
00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:15.285
And also, uh, yeah, much cheaper as well.

276
00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:18.405
Yeah, no, it's, it's, you know,

277
00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:21.045
it's absolutely incredible, you know, to

278
00:12:21.145 --> 00:12:22.285
to, to get to that level.

279
00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:24.485
And, you know, for everybody listening to this,

280
00:12:24.485 --> 00:12:27.045
you'll start seeing, you know, us talk a bit more,

281
00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:28.845
uh, publicly about this.

282
00:12:28.845 --> 00:12:30.165
We've been running in beta programs

283
00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:32.485
and various things, you know, throughout, you know, the,

284
00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:34.005
the, the end of last year, you know,

285
00:12:34.025 --> 00:12:36.525
but, um, you know, we're, you know, we're, we're,

286
00:12:36.525 --> 00:12:38.485
we're going big with it, you know, now this, this year.

287
00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:39.685
So there'll be a a lot more

288
00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:41.045
to come there, but it's already in the product.

289
00:12:41.045 --> 00:12:42.445
It's already there if anybody wants to try

290
00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:43.925
and use it, you know, that's, that's fantastic.

291
00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:47.445
Okay. So just wanna move on to something slightly different,

292
00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:49.525
a little bit of a, you know, what's coming next?

293
00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:51.045
Where are we going, what are we trying to do?

294
00:12:51.065 --> 00:12:53.285
And if I channel this idea, you know, that we said

295
00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:55.805
before, you know, which is driving everything that we do

296
00:12:55.805 --> 00:12:57.925
inside, we want to keep the costs down, we want

297
00:12:57.925 --> 00:13:01.045
to remove the complexity, remove, you know, the challenges.

298
00:13:01.225 --> 00:13:03.565
One of the challenges that we would've got in the past is

299
00:13:03.945 --> 00:13:07.605
people talking about this, this idea, the AI is fantastic.

300
00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:10.245
You know, I can get my product, you know, schema

301
00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:11.565
as you guys have specified it,

302
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:15.445
but I've got a, you know, I'm in a particular industry.

303
00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:18.165
I'm, or I'm in a particular use case where there are,

304
00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:20.765
you know, maybe some extra things that are available,

305
00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:24.205
you know, that I, I now have to go and, you know,

306
00:13:24.225 --> 00:13:25.845
and I have to write some extra code,

307
00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:28.845
or I have to do something to get at the, at these extra bits

308
00:13:28.845 --> 00:13:31.045
that are not maybe in the, in the generic schema

309
00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:32.885
that the model was originally trained for.

310
00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:36.365
And, you know, we, you know, you demoed, you know,

311
00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:38.725
for anybody who would've seen the, uh, the,

312
00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:41.085
the extract summit, um, you know, live

313
00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:44.245
or the recordings, you know, you demoed our new capability

314
00:13:44.245 --> 00:13:46.685
around custom attributes at that, at that event.

315
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.805
You know, maybe you can just give us a little bit

316
00:13:48.805 --> 00:13:50.685
of background to, again, to that project,

317
00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:54.165
why we're doing it, you know, what we're, what, what we're,

318
00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:56.765
um, achieving with that now at this point. Yeah,

319
00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:57.915
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's,

320
00:13:57.915 --> 00:13:59.845
that's a very, very interesting development.

321
00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:02.245
So yeah, like we, we, we always notice

322
00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:05.805
that in most projects, people always want something extra,

323
00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:07.965
uh, something custom, which doesn't make sense

324
00:14:07.965 --> 00:14:09.205
to include in the main model.

325
00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:13.205
Let's say it's, you are crawling like, uh, jigsaw puzzles,

326
00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:15.005
and you want to know what is the number

327
00:14:15.005 --> 00:14:16.205
of pieces in each puzzle.

328
00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:17.885
And this field can be, like,

329
00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:20.005
spelled slightly differently on different websites.

330
00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:24.005
But, uh, yeah, if you, if you were to, uh, to get it,

331
00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:25.285
you'd need to write some code

332
00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:28.485
and then going from zero code to some code, it,

333
00:14:28.745 --> 00:14:30.525
it immediately increases Yeah.

334
00:14:30.865 --> 00:14:32.965
The cost of the project and the time it takes.

335
00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:37.205
And yeah, so with like A-C-G-B-T excitement,

336
00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:39.525
and we saw immediately that, okay,

337
00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:42.045
this is something which, uh, it can do.

338
00:14:42.305 --> 00:14:47.085
And, um, like it can actually, uh, extract, um, uh,

339
00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:49.445
new attributes, uh, just by, uh,

340
00:14:49.445 --> 00:14:52.125
reading the user description of this attribute,

341
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:55.325
basically the name, and sometimes, um, like some description

342
00:14:55.325 --> 00:14:56.485
and the type of attribute.

343
00:14:57.025 --> 00:15:01.195
And also, um, like having the access

344
00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:02.715
to the text of the webpage.

345
00:15:03.255 --> 00:15:06.835
Um, but also we saw that, like, we didn't want to use OpenAI

346
00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:10.915
APIs because like, this is like problematic

347
00:15:10.975 --> 00:15:14.675
for many customers to use like some third party APIs

348
00:15:14.675 --> 00:15:17.515
because they, they don't know okay, what will happen with,

349
00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:19.755
uh, with the data they're sending.

350
00:15:20.135 --> 00:15:22.795
And, uh, it's also like, we don't have any control.

351
00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.755
We can't guarantee low response times

352
00:15:24.855 --> 00:15:25.875
and so on and so forth.

353
00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:29.195
So, and also there was like an explosion in open source

354
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:33.035
ecosystem with like people, uh, replicating, uh,

355
00:15:33.035 --> 00:15:35.235
these capabilities with like Facebook

356
00:15:35.295 --> 00:15:37.755
and meta releasing like Lama series of models.

357
00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:41.955
And so we saw that we can actually, uh, implement it using,

358
00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:43.595
um, like our old models,

359
00:15:43.595 --> 00:15:45.035
which are based on open source models,

360
00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:48.035
so we could fine tune them on this task

361
00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:52.755
and basically allow, uh, you as an API user to just specify,

362
00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.275
okay, this is like extra attributes I want to include.

363
00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:59.195
And then, uh, we would fetch them, uh, using lms.

364
00:15:59.195 --> 00:16:00.795
And this is coming later this year.

365
00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:02.715
Yeah, no, it's, it's fantastic.

366
00:16:02.835 --> 00:16:05.755
I think we, I think that's probably gonna be one of our, uh,

367
00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:07.875
other talks that it's, it's worth doing,

368
00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:10.835
because I know your team, you know, did a, a, an evaluation

369
00:16:10.835 --> 00:16:12.515
of a lot of the, you know, the public models,

370
00:16:12.775 --> 00:16:14.955
the commercial ones, as well as, you know, many

371
00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:17.035
of the open source, you know, ones and so on.

372
00:16:17.115 --> 00:16:19.075
I think it will be even just, just generally of interest

373
00:16:19.075 --> 00:16:20.915
to people, you know, what your team found and so on.

374
00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:22.515
So that's possibly one we can come back to.

375
00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:26.315
Um, I think it's, it, it's also, you know, really important

376
00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:30.795
to, you know, to recognize that, um, our, you know, so, so

377
00:16:30.795 --> 00:16:34.115
that's now taking the ability of, uh, you know,

378
00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:38.875
AI extraction at scale, then adding this ability to do,

379
00:16:39.175 --> 00:16:40.915
you know, custom attributes

380
00:16:41.015 --> 00:16:43.675
as we're just calling it also at scale

381
00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:48.275
and at the, you know, price points that are, you know, um,

382
00:16:48.655 --> 00:16:52.095
you know, won't obviously be at the same cost as, you know,

383
00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.975
regular extraction because there's a bit more compute going

384
00:16:53.975 --> 00:16:55.975
on, but, you know, but those price points will certainly be,

385
00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.695
you know, way, way lower than, um, you know, having to

386
00:16:59.245 --> 00:17:01.095
hand code it and do it all yourself.

387
00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:04.015
And the real beauty of all of this is the ability

388
00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:06.375
that it's effectively, you know, it's adaptive,

389
00:17:06.515 --> 00:17:09.455
it self maintains, you know, it reacts to what's going on

390
00:17:09.455 --> 00:17:11.775
with the underlying capability, which is fantastic.

391
00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:14.775
Uh, another kind of, I suppose sneak peek to something

392
00:17:14.775 --> 00:17:17.295
that's coming real soon is, you know, this idea

393
00:17:17.295 --> 00:17:19.935
that we're calling, uh, AI scraping, you know,

394
00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:22.535
which builds on, you know, a lot of the, you know,

395
00:17:22.535 --> 00:17:24.095
the capability that we've talked about before,

396
00:17:24.235 --> 00:17:26.455
but comes at it from a slightly different angle.

397
00:17:26.675 --> 00:17:28.575
You know, maybe you could just explain, you know,

398
00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:30.215
what we have in mind there to everyone.

399
00:17:30.805 --> 00:17:31.855
Yeah, yeah, sure. So

400
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:35.375
with zet PI like the main capability is that we can send it

401
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:38.295
to URL and it would extract, let's say product

402
00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:40.055
or article, uh, or job posting

403
00:17:40.275 --> 00:17:42.335
or like any other data type attributes.

404
00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.335
Um, the problem with it, with this though, is

405
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.655
that normally people want to, uh,

406
00:17:47.755 --> 00:17:49.685
get the data like from one website

407
00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:52.125
or from like, even a lot of websites.

408
00:17:52.225 --> 00:17:55.565
And to do that, they need to like visit all the pages they,

409
00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:58.365
they want to, to get, uh, data from.

410
00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.605
And so this part would require some development.

411
00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:04.445
But then now we, uh, yeah, as I said,

412
00:18:04.445 --> 00:18:08.245
we also provide like models which can understand not only

413
00:18:08.245 --> 00:18:09.445
individual product pages,

414
00:18:09.545 --> 00:18:12.685
but also like sections of the website, let's say a page

415
00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:15.285
with like a list of products or a list of categories.

416
00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:18.525
And they can do like extraction of links from them.

417
00:18:18.905 --> 00:18:20.765
And using this as primitives,

418
00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:24.085
we can actually write like a quite a generic, um, spider,

419
00:18:24.085 --> 00:18:25.645
which works on any website

420
00:18:25.925 --> 00:18:28.885
because of this primitives work on any website.

421
00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:33.285
And so what it allows you to do is you can go to the ui,

422
00:18:33.305 --> 00:18:35.685
you can enter, let's say the website URL

423
00:18:35.705 --> 00:18:38.005
or like a part, like a section of the website

424
00:18:38.345 --> 00:18:40.325
and, um, like select the data type

425
00:18:40.325 --> 00:18:43.525
and hit like, for now it's only products, uh, hit Go.

426
00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:47.325
And basically the, the crawler is running in scrappy cloud

427
00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:50.485
and it's getting, uh, getting you the data according

428
00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:51.685
to the product schema.

429
00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:53.405
Um, yeah. And

430
00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:57.165
because like, there was like actually a similar feature in,

431
00:18:57.465 --> 00:18:59.205
uh, legacy out extract project,

432
00:18:59.265 --> 00:19:03.205
but uh, it was like a custom UI built for this.

433
00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:06.045
And now with that API, we opted

434
00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:08.285
to use the scrape cloud as a basis for this.

435
00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.925
And we also open sourcing, well,

436
00:19:10.945 --> 00:19:13.965
we already open sourced the crawler itself,

437
00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:16.805
so you can actually, um, if you want to tweak,

438
00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:19.685
let's say the crawling strategy, you can actually modify it,

439
00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:21.725
upload it to scrape cloud and run it,

440
00:19:22.145 --> 00:19:24.005
and yeah, to support all of that,

441
00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:27.085
like we added some special, uh, new features

442
00:19:27.385 --> 00:19:30.365
to Scrappy Cloud, which allow you to specify like,

443
00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:33.845
which arguments you want to basically satisfy the arguments,

444
00:19:33.845 --> 00:19:36.205
which provides a very nice user experience for that.

445
00:19:36.745 --> 00:19:39.805
And also, since it's scrapy cloud, it also has the api,

446
00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:42.325
so now you can control the crawls, uh,

447
00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:44.085
for the API, uh, as well.

448
00:19:45.095 --> 00:19:47.985
Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's a, it's, it's, uh,

449
00:19:48.065 --> 00:19:51.025
particularly exciting kinda bringing a lot

450
00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:53.385
of this together now, you know, where, you know, we,

451
00:19:53.405 --> 00:19:56.785
we have, you know, we're doing, you know, hundreds

452
00:19:56.785 --> 00:19:59.505
of millions of, you know, requests, you know, every month,

453
00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:02.065
you know, with, with, you know, around extraction requests,

454
00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:04.305
you know, we're, you know, we've got, you know, some

455
00:20:04.305 --> 00:20:05.785
of the largest organizations in the world

456
00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:07.025
are using this capability.

457
00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.545
We use our, our whole whole delivery team are using,

458
00:20:09.645 --> 00:20:11.505
you know, many of these, you know, these capabilities.

459
00:20:11.965 --> 00:20:14.665
You know, and, and you know, we've, you know, uh, you know,

460
00:20:14.665 --> 00:20:17.385
as I said, we've, we, we we're dedicated as an organization

461
00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:20.065
to, you know, to removing the complexity to kind

462
00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:21.545
of simplify all of this.

463
00:20:21.565 --> 00:20:23.665
We, we understand a lot of this is complicated,

464
00:20:23.665 --> 00:20:24.905
and so we're trying to, we're we're trying

465
00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:27.385
to bring it together, but one last kind of, you know,

466
00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:30.945
teaser, you know, kind of piece related to, to, to AI

467
00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:32.025
that I just want to touch on.

468
00:20:32.725 --> 00:20:35.345
Uh, and it's, it's back at this same point again about,

469
00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:36.665
you know, making things simple.

470
00:20:36.805 --> 00:20:38.945
So you mentioned earlier that, you know, now

471
00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:41.505
with extraction, we have, you have two choices as a,

472
00:20:41.505 --> 00:20:44.145
as a developer, you can, you can get the full rendered,

473
00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:46.865
you know, browser rendered version of, of, of extraction,

474
00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:49.765
or you can get the, the raw HT ML version of extraction.

475
00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:52.325
And you know, it, it, you know, obviously that's fantastic,

476
00:20:52.355 --> 00:20:54.685
it's great capability, but it means as a developer you have

477
00:20:54.685 --> 00:20:56.325
to make a choice, you know, which should use,

478
00:20:56.385 --> 00:20:57.525
and maybe you have to do experiment,

479
00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:58.605
but we're working on something

480
00:20:58.605 --> 00:20:59.805
and maybe you could tell, you know,

481
00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:01.325
the audience a little bit about, you know,

482
00:21:01.325 --> 00:21:02.445
what we have in mind, you know,

483
00:21:02.445 --> 00:21:04.045
that'll be coming soon, or, or,

484
00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:06.875
Yeah. So yeah, the

485
00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:08.205
here the problem is

486
00:21:08.205 --> 00:21:11.405
that like the raw extraction is very attractive

487
00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:13.405
because it's, yeah, so cheap and fast,

488
00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:16.605
but it won't work on some websites if they require

489
00:21:16.605 --> 00:21:17.845
JavaScript rendering.

490
00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:21.085
And like a lot of people, they need to crawl like hundreds

491
00:21:21.085 --> 00:21:22.525
of thousands of websites.

492
00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.285
And so like for them to check every website,

493
00:21:25.635 --> 00:21:29.005
whether which method to prefer, it's just not feasible.

494
00:21:29.385 --> 00:21:33.245
Uh, that's why we default, uh, to browser, uh,

495
00:21:33.255 --> 00:21:35.085
extraction right now, uh,

496
00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.085
because it's like, yeah, the most generic.

497
00:21:37.185 --> 00:21:40.485
So it, it will do a, like good job, uh, in all cases,

498
00:21:41.305 --> 00:21:45.605
but, uh, we may, yeah, missing out on these improvements.

499
00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:48.725
And so what we're working on is like this, uh, intelligent,

500
00:21:48.985 --> 00:21:52.285
uh, switching, uh, to raw extraction if we see

501
00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:55.085
that it's actually providing, uh, good results.

502
00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:59.125
And, um, so, uh, later this year when you're making, uh,

503
00:21:59.255 --> 00:22:02.925
extraction without specifying exact method to use, uh, like

504
00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:06.485
behind the scenes, we would, uh, switch to the best method

505
00:22:06.585 --> 00:22:07.645
for these websites.

506
00:22:07.665 --> 00:22:10.365
And this would happen, like completely transparently.

507
00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:13.445
And also there won't be like any delay here.

508
00:22:13.585 --> 00:22:16.045
So even from the first request, we would like

509
00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:20.365
behind the scenes, uh, try, uh, both methods at once

510
00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.845
and see which one is better,

511
00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:24.325
and then return you, uh, the best results.

512
00:22:24.345 --> 00:22:26.885
And also, uh, very quickly would switch

513
00:22:26.885 --> 00:22:29.405
to always using a particular downloading method,

514
00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:31.005
uh, for this website.

515
00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:34.045
Yeah, no, and, and of course our, our,

516
00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:36.685
our cunning master plan is to weave that in

517
00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:40.245
behind the scenes behind AI scraping, behind, you know,

518
00:22:40.245 --> 00:22:42.605
general extraction behind the APIs.

519
00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.205
So, you know, we can, you know,

520
00:22:44.205 --> 00:22:45.645
just make it as easy as possible.

521
00:22:45.705 --> 00:22:47.925
But of course, in all cases, allow, you know,

522
00:22:47.925 --> 00:22:49.885
allow overrides, allow people to, you know,

523
00:22:49.885 --> 00:22:51.925
if they have a particular choice, you can do that as well.

524
00:22:52.065 --> 00:22:54.245
And, and of course, you know, we want to make sure that all

525
00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:55.805
of these things are available, you know,

526
00:22:55.805 --> 00:22:59.005
callable via our open source tools and, you know, and so on.

527
00:22:59.005 --> 00:23:01.085
So that's, that's, that's, uh, where we're coming from.

528
00:23:01.105 --> 00:23:03.845
So listen, uh, great chat, Constantine.

529
00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:06.685
You know, I think we, we covered a lot of, you know,

530
00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:09.925
what we're doing here, um, in the AI space.

531
00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:12.965
You know, we, we didn't even touch on some of the use cases

532
00:23:13.035 --> 00:23:15.005
that, you know, our clients are doing.

533
00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:17.245
You know, we're, we're providing them with a whole lot

534
00:23:17.245 --> 00:23:19.005
of things that they're doing really exciting things from an

535
00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:20.685
AI perspective, but maybe we'll come back to

536
00:23:20.685 --> 00:23:22.485
that in another, in another talk.

537
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:25.285
Um, but, uh, thanks for your time today, Constantine,

538
00:23:25.305 --> 00:23:26.645
and you know, if, if,

539
00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:29.085
if anyone has any questions, you know where to find us.

540
00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:30.925
And so thanks all. Yeah,

541
00:23:30.965 --> 00:23:31.965
See you soon. Thank you. Yeah,

542
00:23:31.965 --> 00:23:33.085
thank you. See you.
