Sparse use case Data gathering questions:
    - roadblock or 'nice to have'
    - measure the difficult and evaluate the rollback to develop a possible feature
    - is data redundant
    - data stored in object should be unique? 

Sparse data gathering true positive:
    • Is this data sparse or dense? Will it be relevant and populated in every listing, or
    just a handful out of the set?
    • How large is the data?
    • Especially in the case of large data, will I need to regularly retrieve it every time I
    run my analysis, or only on occasion?
    • How variable is this type of data? Will I regularly need to add new attributes,
    modify types (such as fabric patterns, which may be added frequently), or is it set
    in stone (shoe sizes)?


If data is sparse (relatively few products have
any one of the attributes), and that you may decide to add or remove attributes fre‐
quently. In this case, it may make sense to create a product type that looks like this:
• Product title
• Manufacturer
• Product ID number (if available/relevant)
• Attributes (optional list or dictionary)
And an attribute type that looks like this:
• Attribute name
• Attribute value
